# Introduction to JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript (JS) is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It's a programming language that allows you to create dynamic and interactive content on websites.

- **HTML**: Defines the structure and content of web pages.
- **CSS**: Controls the presentation and styling (layout, colors, fonts).
- **JavaScript**: Adds behavior and interactivity (responding to clicks, updating content, etc.).

Initially used in web browsers, JavaScript now also runs on servers (Node.js), mobile devices, and more.

## Why Learn JavaScript?

- **Essential for Web Development**: Powers virtually all modern websites and web applications.
- **Versatile**: Used for front-end (browser), back-end (server), mobile apps, and more.
- **High Demand**: A fundamental skill for web developers.
- **Large Community**: Access to countless libraries, frameworks (like React, Angular, Vue), and resources.

## Core Concepts We'll Cover

This course will guide you through the essentials, including:

1.  **Fundamentals**: Variables, data types, operators.
2.  **Control Flow**: Making decisions (`if`/`else`) and repeating actions (loops).
3.  **Functions**: Writing reusable blocks of code.
4.  **Data Structures**: Working with collections like arrays and objects.
5.  **DOM Manipulation**: Interacting with HTML elements on a web page.
6.  **Asynchronous Programming**: Handling operations that take time (like fetching data).

## Next Steps

To start coding, you'll need a basic setup. The next lesson guides you through installing the necessary tools: a code editor and a web browser. Let's get your development environment ready!
